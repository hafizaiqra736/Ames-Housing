Ames Housing Dataset Project
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the Ames Housing dataset, a detailed dataset of property sales. The goal of the project is to explore various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and deep learning methods to create accurate predictive models. Below is a summary of the steps and methodologies used in this project.

Project Overview
In this project, I have employed several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Additionally, I implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict house prices.

Key Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Data Loading: The dataset was loaded from a zipped file.
Missing Value Imputation: For numerical features, missing values were imputed using the mean strategy. For categorical features, the most frequent strategy was applied.
One-Hot Encoding: Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Scaling: Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler to normalize the input data.
Handling Ordinal Variables: Certain variables such as quality ratings were treated as ordinal variables and encoded accordingly using LabelEncoder.
2. Modeling
Linear Regression: A basic linear model was implemented as a baseline. The model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
Random Forest Regressor: A more complex ensemble method, Random Forest, was applied to the dataset to improve performance.
Decision Tree Regressor: A single decision tree model was built to explore non-linear relationships within the data.
XGBoost: An advanced gradient boosting model was used with tuned hyperparameters to further enhance performance.
LightGBM: Another gradient boosting model, LightGBM, was trained and evaluated to compare results with other methods.
CatBoost: CatBoost was employed due to its robustness with categorical data and its ability to handle complex data patterns.
3. Deep Learning Model
Neural Network (Keras): A sequential neural network model was built with several layers including dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. Exponential learning rate decay was implemented for efficient learning. The model was trained with early stopping to halt training when the validation loss stopped improving.
4. Evaluation
Metrics Used: The models were evaluated using common regression metrics such as MSE and RMSE. For each model, these metrics were calculated and compared.
Training and Validation Loss Plot: For the deep learning model, the training and validation loss were plotted over epochs to monitor the model’s performance and ensure that overfitting was avoided.
5. Results
Each model’s performance was evaluated in terms of MSE, RMSE, and R-squared to determine the best-performing model.
The XGBoost and CatBoost models showed strong performance, while the Random Forest Regressor also delivered competitive results.
The deep learning model provided insights into the application of neural networks to this problem and allowed for flexible experimentation with different architectures.
Conclusion
This project explored a variety of machine learning techniques and deep learning methodologies for predicting house prices in the Ames dataset. The experience highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in the creation of robust predictive models.
